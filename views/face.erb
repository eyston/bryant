<h2>What Should Be Ours</h2>
<p>I want our Solon school board to be VERY proactive in regards to securing the TPP funds or at least the amount we had received from the state under a new formula.  I will not claim to know what can or cannot be accomplished, but I would explore forcing the State to set out dates beyond, or at least equal to those for which our schools are required to forecast.  Right now, the State requires school districts to forecast out 5 years ahead, and the districts cannot operate in a deficit.  I think that is great!  What I do not like is the idea of the State changing the rules, procedures and/or budgeted dollars and cents that districts are basing their forecasts off of because of the whim of the State.  Essentially, all school districts are being forced to live with what could be compared to a variable rate mortgage relationship with the State.  It was great when Ohio had a surplus, but as of late almost every district is feeling the squeeze from a brand new set of rules and amounts.  Solon was able to weather this storm this past Spring, but it was not automatic, and it also was not an easy road. I would work for a more consistent answer from the State. Last Spring our elected representatives, administration and residents rallied and received a reprieve, but it wasn't perfect. In fact, it was not equitable across the State, and especially to those communities that have planned with large commercial bases in their city, like Solon. There are roughly 40 districts in Ohio that are similar to us in this way. </p>

<h2>State Funding</h2>
<p>The State's funding formula must be addressed, and I want Solon to be a part of creating the solution. We do a great deal of things right in the Solon school district, and Solon can be a model to other districts. Shouldn't we want to be part of the funding solution? I feel if we aren't part of the solution, we may be forced to operate with others' problems! We need to insure that the lack of planning and failure to address this logically on the part of the State, does not become Solon's emergency.

<h2>Residency</h2>
<p>I do not think either of these ideas above are unique to me, or exclusive from my opponents. An original idea I will suggest from my seat on the board ties directly to some of my own involvement at Solon city hall.  I would like to foster a closer and different relationship with the city to ensure that new students to our district are residents of our community. With accountability and performance rightfully expected by our residents, it is only right to expect that our schools use their time, energies and funds on our residents. What many see as a tragic case in Copley where a mother was sentenced to jail time for falsifying her children's residency is really a matter of services provided being stolen by others at the cost of the taxpayers of another city.  Only 35% of Solon homes have children in the schools, yet 100% of our residents and business pay into our schools. Early last year I spoke to Superintendent Joe Regano, and asked him if the schools would possibly want to share a database with the city to have another layer of accountability to insure our students' residency. When he saw it as another tool, and safeguard for resources, I brought it forward to City Council.  Individually, myself and some other residents went to many members of our City Council to express this as a benefit to our schools and accountability to the residents. I was able to coordinate many residents to come out in support of this legislation, and while it was not an easy or quick process, it finally passed, 5-2. I would hope that this can now be a tool where the schools can insure that we are using our time and resources to educate and provide for only our students.</p>

<a name="communication" />
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>As a board member, I wouId coomunicate the terms and measures the state uses and changes from time to time. For example, I would want to make sure that the community understood that the State is using the same term to evaluate a different standard this year. Solon has been a district that has often earned the "excellent with distinction" tag, and this year that label was not included. To the public it is easy to jump to the conclusion that somehow we are no longer "distinct", but in reality the State is now using "with distinction" to show annual growth exceeding expectations. This is where it can get a little tricky, since there will be schools this year that receive the "with distinction" tag, but come nowhere near to performing or achieving what Solon students will by year's end.  This is a communication issue, and possibly something that needs to be brought up with the state, to potentially use a different title than the one many think means something else. Personally, I say look at how many students we will have receiving National Merit awards: that will be a "distinction" of which many schools cannot boast.</p>

<a name="taxes" />
<h2>Property Taxes</h2>
<p>I also see our current dependence on property taxes as an area of concern as well. The Ohio State Supreme court has repeatedly ruled that our State's reliance upon property tax is unconstitutional. I am not really sure where we could go to fix this, but I would hope that we as a board and many of its residents could start to look ahead of the problem to prepare for our answer.</p>

<p>Financially, I also see today's market place as a double-edged sword. Our businesses are feeling the constricting forces of today economy, which in turn is pushing this to our work force, which ultimately ends up impacting our families and residents. For years, there has always been a need for empathy for our seniors on fixed incomes and now many would love if their incomes were guaranteed to be fixed, unfortunately, an even larger section of society, including the seniors, are seeing their incomes shrink. Levies have always been supported in Solon, but many fear that their property taxes will tax themselves out of their home. Last Spring the district faced a very real and scary budget forecast, as a result of some of Columbus' "great" ideas. All our residents feared for the worst, and thanks to many of the city's residents rallying, along with others from similar districts throughout the State, our district was able to recoup a substantial portion of what we stood to lose.  It should also be noted that our district's various collective bargaining units stepped up, and negotiated in the understanding of where the economy is, and where our district needs to be to continue to offer what the residents value and want continued.  I want to see more consideration afforded to responsible districts like Solon from the State. This in turn will allow more consideration for our residents. The Solon City Schools have a habit of making sure that levies out last their expectations; I want to see this practice continued. It's never easy, but scrutiny and understanding allow for greater understanding so that tough decisions can be made without compromising the final product.</p>

<h2>Keeping Politics Out</h2>
<p>In closing, the seats on school boards are contested through a nonpartisan election. The elected officials are asked to represent Independents, Democrats and Republicans alike. They are also elected to represent and make decisions impacting those that cannot vote yet, our city's children who will become the professionals of tomorrow. It would be an honor to represent the residents of Solon, collaborate with our talented staff, and bring my qualifications and accountability to the Solon School Board.</p>
