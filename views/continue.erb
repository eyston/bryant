<h2>Fiscal Responsibility</h2>
<p>Our school district is performing well, in fact I would argue exceptionally well. Our family made a conscious decision to move to a city that valued its schools and the academic opportunities afforded to its children. This has not changed, and we could not be happier. One thing that I think Solon does better than many other districts is how they plan for the future. Our Treasurer, Tim Pickana, consistently forecasts and analyzes where we will be from a financial standpoint. Our Superintendent, Joe Regano, and his staff look for ways to run things in the most efficient manner without compromising the product they provide. Our faculty constantly ensures that as standards and expectations change our course offerings and objectives mirror these changes.  Solon continuously looks forward and tries to anticipate what the work force, universities and the world will want tomorrow. Because of this, our Middle School offers many foreign languages including Chinese, and our high school's AP courses are truly exemplary.</p>

<h2>A Variety of Extra-Curricular Programs</h2>
<p>Another area where I think Solon outperforms so many is in the quality of its extra-curricular offerings.  Solon recognizes that learning is not constrained to the time between the opening and closing bell.  Many are aware of the success of our schools' athletic teams.  You may not be aware that our musical programs put on concerts that rival those of professional performances. The performing and vocal arts groups truly exceed expectations that many have for students. Solon's academic extra-curricular teams set the bar for the nation, with our junior high and senior high Science Olympiad teams winning multiple national titles.  Today's world is not an easy place to be as a teenage student.  Solon provides something for everyone, helping students to find a place where they feel they belong.  Most importantly it's through school. The kids know they need school. We have parents that demand that our kids pull their weight and take advantage of every opportunity afforded to them, yet it is through school that our kids can feel they belong while achieving their ultimate goals. The fact that our city, the students, their families and the Solon School's staff members all share in this vision of what tomorrow will ask of our kids is why I think Solon continues to perform at such a high level!</p>

<h2>Exceeding Academic Excellence</h2>
<p>I think a major component to the success of our students, is the Solon schools' ability to plan for what will be demanded of them after they graduate. Our students are offered an amazing myriad of classes, experiences, training with technologies, networking and team building opportunities that is second to none. For those that are willing to engage in these challenges, put forth their best effort and follow through with their responsibilities, the possibilities are truly endless with a diploma from Solon High School. I will continue to push for accountability and support our programs and offerings that enrich and ensure learning and the development of critical thinking. To see proof of how truly amazing our kids are, look at the list of prestigious universities our students are accepted into,  the number of students (238) that earn AP Scholar awards, and the number of students that are recognized as National Merit Semifinalists and National Merit Scholars. While we may have lost the State's title of "distinction" because they measure for it differently now, I feel very confident in our ability to produce students that not only compete nationally, but also ultimately win. I not only want to see this excellence continued for your children, but for my 7 year old son in the district as well!</p>

<p>The greatest concern to the residents of Solon is to insure that the excellence of the Solon Public Schools continues to be available to all children in Solon going into the future. Pressures are coming from so many different directions. Demanding accountability, scrutiny of funding, and a struggling economy that is tightening on so many, all stand to make this a very volatile time for schools everywhere, especially Solon. The foundation of what is in place is an amazing platform to build off of, yet the residents of Solon cannot rest with what has been accomplished. </p>
