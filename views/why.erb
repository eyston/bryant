<h1>Why I am running for Solon School Board</h1>

<p>I am running for a seat on the Solon School Board for multiple reasons. The most important one to me personally is my 7 year old son who attends school in the district.  He is very early on in the journey that will see him graduate a Solon Comet with a love for learning and a set of tools that come from the relationships, experiences and lessons he will have in this district. Secondly, I believe I bring a skill set and experiences that are unique and would serve the city, schools and board well.  Lastly, I think the flexibility that being a stay-at-home Dad provides can allow me to take on an active role that may require daytime commitments, possibly in Columbus lobbying the State, collaborating with our in house and other professionals, or just being able to support our day to day observations that take place during the normal business day.</p>

<p>In talking to many people in Solon this Summer and Fall, most have asked, "What is my stance?"  Here is the short answer. My family moved here because of the schools.  I want to ensure that our Solon schools continue to lead the way, as they have, and provide for future generations of Comets so that when they graduate they are either sought after by Universities for further education, or are ready to enter into the world as model citizens in whatever endeavors they choose.</p>

<h1>Continuing the Success</h1>
<h2>Fiscal Responsibility</h2>
<p>Our school district is performing well, in fact I would argue exceptionally well. Our family made a conscious decision to move to a city that valued its schools and the academic opportunities afforded to its children. This has not changed, and we could not be happier. One thing that I think Solon does better than many other districts is how they plan for the future. Our Treasurer, Tim Pickana, consistently forecasts and analyzes where we will be from a financial standpoint. Our Superintendent, Joe Regano, and his staff look for ways to run things in the most efficient manner without compromising the product they provide. Our faculty constantly ensures that as standards and expectations change our course offerings and objectives mirror these changes.  Solon continuously looks forward and tries to anticipate what the work force, universities and the world will want tomorrow. Because of this, our Middle School offers many foreign languages including Chinese, and our high school's AP courses are truly exemplary.</p>

<h2>A Variety of Extra-Curricular Programs</h2>
<p>Another area where I think Solon outperforms so many is in the quality of its extra-curricular offerings.  Solon recognizes that learning is not constrained to the time between the opening and closing bell.  Many are aware of the success of our schools' athletic teams.  You may not be aware that our musical programs put on concerts that rival those of professional performances. The performing and vocal arts groups truly exceed expectations that many have for students. Solon's academic extra-curricular teams set the bar for the nation, with our junior high and senior high Science Olympiad teams winning multiple national titles.  Today's world is not an easy place to be as a teenage student.  Solon provides something for everyone, helping students to find a place where they feel they belong.  Most importantly it's through school. The kids know they need school. We have parents that demand that our kids pull their weight and take advantage of every opportunity afforded to them, yet it is through school that our kids can feel they belong while achieving their ultimate goals. The fact that our city, the students, their families and the Solon School's staff members all share in this vision of what tomorrow will ask of our kids is why I think Solon continues to perform at such a high level!</p>

<h2>Exceeding Academic Excellence</h2>
<p>I think a major component to the success of our students, is the Solon schools' ability to plan for what will be demanded of them after they graduate. Our students are offered an amazing myriad of classes, experiences, training with technologies, networking and team building opportunities that is second to none. For those that are willing to engage in these challenges, put forth their best effort and follow through with their responsibilities, the possibilities are truly endless with a diploma from Solon High School. I will continue to push for accountability and support our programs and offerings that enrich and ensure learning and the development of critical thinking. To see proof of how truly amazing our kids are, look at the list of prestigious universities our students are accepted into,  the number of students (238) that earn AP Scholar awards, and the number of students that are recognized as National Merit Semifinalists and National Merit Scholars. While we may have lost the State's title of "distinction" because they measure for it differently now, I feel very confident in our ability to produce students that not only compete nationally, but also ultimately win. I not only want to see this excellence continued for your children, but for my 7 year old son in the district as well!</p>

<p>The greatest concern to the residents of Solon is to insure that the excellence of the Solon Public Schools continues to be available to all children in Solon going into the future. Pressures are coming from so many different directions. Demanding accountability, scrutiny of funding, and a struggling economy that is tightening on so many, all stand to make this a very volatile time for schools everywhere, especially Solon. The foundation of what is in place is an amazing platform to build off of, yet the residents of Solon cannot rest with what has been accomplished. </p>


<h1>Facing the Issues</h1>
<h2>What Should Be Ours</h2>
<p>I want our Solon school board to be VERY proactive in regards to securing the TPP funds or at least the amount we had received from the state under a new formula.  I will not claim to know what can or cannot be accomplished, but I would explore forcing the State to set out dates beyond, or at least equal to those for which our schools are required to forecast.  Right now, the State requires school districts to forecast out 5 years ahead, and the districts cannot operate in a deficit.  I think that is great!  What I do not like is the idea of the State changing the rules, procedures and/or budgeted dollars and cents that districts are basing their forecasts off of because of the whim of the State.  Essentially, all school districts are being forced to live with what could be compared to a variable rate mortgage relationship with the State.  It was great when Ohio had a surplus, but as of late almost every district is feeling the squeeze from a brand new set of rules and amounts.  Solon was able to weather this storm this past Spring, but it was not automatic, and it also was not an easy road. I would work for a more consistent answer from the State. Last Spring our elected representatives, administration and residents rallied and received a reprieve, but it wasn't perfect. In fact, it was not equitable across the State, and especially to those communities that have planned with large commercial bases in their city, like Solon. There are roughly 40 districts in Ohio that are similar to us in this way. </p>


<h2>State Funding</h2>
<p>The State's funding formula must be addressed, and I want Solon to be a part of creating the solution. We do a great deal of things right in the Solon school district, and Solon can be a model to other districts. Shouldn't we want to be part of the funding solution? I feel if we aren't part of the solution, we may be forced to operate with others' problems! We need to insure that the lack of planning and failure to address this logically on the part of the State, does not become Solon's emergency.  

<h2>Residency</h2>
<p>I do not think either of these ideas above are unique to me, or exclusive from my opponents. An original idea I will suggest from my seat on the board ties directly to some of my own involvement at Solon city hall.  I would like to foster a closer and different relationship with the city to ensure that new students to our district are residents of our community. With accountability and performance rightfully expected by our residents, it is only right to expect that our schools use their time, energies and funds on our residents. What many see as a tragic case in Copley where a mother was sentenced to jail time for falsifying her children's residency is really a matter of services provided being stolen by others at the cost of the taxpayers of another city.  Only 35% of Solon homes have children in the schools, yet 100% of our residents and business pay into our schools. Early last year I spoke to Superintendent Joe Regano, and asked him if the schools would possibly want to share a database with the city to have another layer of accountability to insure our students' residency. When he saw it as another tool, and safeguard for resources, I brought it forward to City Council.  Individually, myself and some other residents went to many members of our City Council to express this as a benefit to our schools and accountability to the residents. I was able to coordinate many residents to come out in support of this legislation, and while it was not an easy or quick process, it finally passed, 5-2. I would hope that this can now be a tool where the schools can insure that we are using our time and resources to educate and provide for only our students.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>As a board member, I wouId coomunicate the terms and measures the state uses and changes from time to time. For example, I would want to make sure that the community understood that the State is using the same term to evaluate a different standard this year. Solon has been a district that has often earned the "excellent with distinction" tag, and this year that label was not included. To the public it is easy to jump to the conclusion that somehow we are no longer "distinct", but in reality the State is now using "with distinction" to show annual growth exceeding expectations. This is where it can get a little tricky, since there will be schools this year that receive the "with distinction" tag, but come nowhere near to performing or achieving what Solon students will by year's end.  This is a communication issue, and possibly something that needs to be brought up with the state, to potentially use a different title than the one many think means something else. Personally, I say look at how many students we will have receiving National Merit awards: that will be a "distinction" of which many schools cannot boast.</p>

<h2>Property Taxes</h2>
<p>I also see our current dependence on property taxes as an area of concern as well. The Ohio State Supreme court has repeatedly ruled that our State's reliance upon property tax is unconstitutional. I am not really sure where we could go to fix this, but I would hope that we as a board and many of its residents could start to look ahead of the problem to prepare for our answer.</p>

<p>Financially, I also see today's market place as a double-edged sword. Our businesses are feeling the constricting forces of today economy, which in turn is pushing this to our work force, which ultimately ends up impacting our families and residents. For years, there has always been a need for empathy for our seniors on fixed incomes and now many would love if their incomes were guaranteed to be fixed, unfortunately, an even larger section of society, including the seniors, are seeing their incomes shrink. Levies have always been supported in Solon, but many fear that their property taxes will tax themselves out of their home. Last Spring the district faced a very real and scary budget forecast, as a result of some of Columbus' "great" ideas. All our residents feared for the worst, and thanks to many of the city's residents rallying, along with others from similar districts throughout the State, our district was able to recoup a substantial portion of what we stood to lose.  It should also be noted that our district's various collective bargaining units stepped up, and negotiated in the understanding of where the economy is, and where our district needs to be to continue to offer what the residents value and want continued.  I want to see more consideration afforded to responsible districts like Solon from the State. This in turn will allow more consideration for our residents. The Solon City Schools have a habit of making sure that levies out last their expectations; I want to see this practice continued. It's never easy, but scrutiny and understanding allow for greater understanding so that tough decisions can be made without compromising the final product.</p>

<h2>Keeping Politics Out</h2>
<p>In closing, the seats on school boards are contested through a nonpartisan election. The elected officials are asked to represent Independents, Democrats and Republicans alike. They are also elected to represent and make decisions impacting those that cannot vote yet, our city's children who will become the professionals of tomorrow. It would be an honor to represent the residents of Solon, collaborate with our talented staff, and bring my qualifications and accountability to the Solon School Board.</p>
